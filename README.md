# Win-Terminal-Retro
Retro styled json settings file for the Windows Terminal

A retro styled theme for the [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/), this is a slightly altered configuration of the config Microsoft has created from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/custom-terminal-gallery/retro-command-prompt). I've simply cleaned up some effects, made it look a bit more modern, and altered the fonts a bit. 

To utilize this color style:

* Open Windows Terminal
* Press *CTRL , +* 
* Copy and paste the json into the "schemes" field.
* Relaunch Windows Terminal
